#thintalk

**Thintalk is a thin RPC layer over different transport layers.**

> RPC is an acronyms for _Remote procedure call_, meaning that the protocol is
> a simple function request with function arguments, and the response will be
> arguments parsed to an callback.
> The result is you can call code on the _server_ without transferee the entire
> function source code.
>
> The benefits of `thintalk` compared to `nowJS` or `dnode` is that this is very
> thin resulting in minimal overhead. However the cost is that this module is not
> meant to be used in combination with none-node clients like browsers.

## Features
 - Simple RPC layer with minimal overhead.
 - Same API independent of the transport layer.

## Installation

```sheel
npm install thintalk
```

## API documentation

###The listener

```javascript
var thintalk = require('thintalk');

var listener = thintalk({
  add: function (a, b) {
    this.callback(a + b);
  }
});

lisenter.on('error', function (err) {
	throw err;
});

// Yes you can listen on multiply transport layers
lisenter.listen('TCP', 4000);
lisenter.listen('IPC', require('child_process').fork('./child.js'));
```

###The TCP requester

```javascript
var thintalk = require('thintalk');

var requester = thintalk(function (remote) {

	remote.add(2, 4, function (result) {
	  console.log(result); // 6
	});

}).connect('TCP', 4000);

requester.on('error', function (err) {
	throw err;
});
```

###The IPC requester

```javascript
var thintalk = require('thintalk');

var requester = thintalk(function (remote) {

	remote.add(2, 4, function (result) {
	  console.log(result); // 6
	});

}).connect('TCP', 4000);

requester.on('error', function (err) {
	throw err;
});
```
